Thanks to the commitent of every single member of the association we manage to accomplish our goals.
Despite the difficulties arisen by the emergency situation of past months the student branch has worked hard as always to carry on different activities, such as the Programma Arnaldo that for the first time had to be held from home.

The award acknowledges and gratifies the efforts we made in the past years. It states that we have really grown up since 2016, the year our association was born and also the last year we have won this award.
