### The role of the Student Branch
This year the Student Branch is engaged to organize the event. Our role is to
participate actively in the organization, publicize everything during these
months through our official channels and part of the staff at the event. This is
an opportunity for the Branch, because it allows us (members) to take part of
a collaboration in a real job activity, networking and the possibility to know
important people in the sector. Indeed the event involves prominent
personalities that they will judge participants ideas (in the link above the
judgesâ€™s instagram page).
