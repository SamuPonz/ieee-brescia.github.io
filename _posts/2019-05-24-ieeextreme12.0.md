## Overview
On the 20 october 2018 it took place the twelfth edition of the **IEEExtreme programming competition**.
For the second year in a row the student branch got involved with 6 teams composed of 14 students, who programmed for 24 hours consecutively. The commitment and the
devotion of the guys have been rewarded, for the second time *the University of Brescia arrived on the podium nationwide!*

## How were these results achieved?
Since the enormous success of the first edition of [Programma Arnaldo](https://ieee-brescia.github.io/programma_arnaldo/) the students who participated to the competition for the first time in 2017 had taken on the role of mentors for the second edition of Program, thus providing to the new subscribers the
algorithmic and computer knowledges, to be able to compete with the
branch students internationally.
