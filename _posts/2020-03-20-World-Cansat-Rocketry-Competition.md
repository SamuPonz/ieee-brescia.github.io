## Overview
The World Cansat Rocketry Competition is an international project born from the collaboration of six different countries: Serbia, Italy, Canada, Tunisia and Perù. Basically, it’s a competition that challenges students from around the world in designing a cansat: a satellite with the size of a can. The european qualifications will be held in Italy, in Brescia, and the winners will have the opportunity to compete worldwide.
The aim of the competition is to allow students to understand what are the challanges of project a satellite: from the initial design to the launch, done with a rocket in which the cansat will be placed in.

## The launch
As mantioned above, the cansat will be plugged into a small rocket and will be launched up to 300 meters far in the sky. After reaching the maximum height, it will begin a1 slow descent thanks to a small parachute. 
During this phase the device will acquire atmospheric data like pressure and temperature using sensors built inside of it and it will transmit the data to the ground station.

## Why should you take part of this competition?
The key work is **progress**. Scientific progress because space exploration represents the future for humanity, but also your personal progress: this competition allows you to acquire also the soft skills useful in the labour market, like problem solving and team-working skills. 

Space exploration is one of the greatest adventures of all time and no nation can expect to lag behind in the space race. It is up to us, students, to shape the future of our planet.
Aerospace progress is in our hands and humanity needs us, are you ready to take the challenge?
