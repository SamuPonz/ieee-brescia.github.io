## The history of the project

The project “**UV oven**” has begun in correspondence with the purchase
of a resin 3D printer by the Information Engineering department in 2016.
The printing process in fact predicts a heat and ultraviolet light treatment
to the printed objects, so to confer to the resin more solidity and make it
usable in the required applications.
Starting from this necessity, it has been thought of a collaboration
between the Department and the Student Branch, which aims to the
realization by the student branch of an oven, which can help the printer
and make the printing process complete.
Following the missed accomplishment of the project and the interruption
of work on the oven , the project was taken up in 2018 by the current
members, with the goal to carry out the oven.

## Changes

This project, in the current form, inherits much of the projectual
strategies and decisions from the former development. For this, many
fundamental aspects were already decided, and changing them would
have led to the discarding of the whole project.

The decision was to leave at first this aspects unchanged and so the
new development has the following base design features:

* Development platform: Arduino;
* Sensoristics and devices: temperature sensor, two heat
resistances, fan, DC engine , UV led, buttons and display
managed via a breadboard;
* Fisic structure: it is assembled in sections of plywood and
plexiglass for the rotating base.

Then, afterwards the already written code’s analysis, it was thought to
introduce changes, both on the hardware and the software side:
* Replacement of the temperature sensor because of not suitable
characteristics for use;
* The introduction of a limit switch for checking the closing of the
door;
* Use of the present buttons on the display because they are more
efficient than the expected ones earlier;
* Rewrite of the code to introduce programming structures more
elaborated, like a class to manage buttons and modify some
managements, as like as the timer to correct the present bugs.

At the end of the tests both the fisic part and the code side, we’re
thinking about the possibility to create a printed circuit board in order to
avoid the use of the breadboard and so to complete the development of
the project.
