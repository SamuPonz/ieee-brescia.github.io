## Overview
Very good results for the first participation in the IEEExtreme 2017 programming competition; 11th edition of the 24 hours competition to which took part more
than 8000 participants, for a total of 3350 teams.
Lorenzo Nodari, Michele Dusi, Claudio Cito, Francesco Cremascoli, Daniele Vezzoli,
Stefano Poma and Nicola Onofri are the 7 students who programmed for 24 hours in
a row, leading the University of Brescia to the podium!

## How did we achieve this goal?
In February, IEEE Student Branch of Brescia has started a programming
course for the students of the first engineering year. The aim is to teach
the base of the object-oriented programming, the course led 21
participants of the âProgramma Arnaldoâ to acquire and/or improve their
own algorithmic knowledge, data structures and searching methods.

You can find more information about Programma Arnaldo [tapping here](/programma_arnaldo/).

## Results

All the italian participating teams have got a result higher than the third
quartile, a result which confirms and attests the real power and
capability of the italian students, the italian universities and the quality of
the available courses.
In Italy, the University of Brescia achieved the third place among all
participating universities, trying for the first time in the history the
preparation of students, not graduated, of the first year for the worldwide
IEEE competition.
Given the results, we intend to propose the"Programma Arnaldo" also in
the following years.
