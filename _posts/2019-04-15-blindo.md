With the project "Blindo" the team commit to **create an educational device** for blind students which allows them to study in a better way.

The **flexibility** of this device makes him usable in **multiple** ways.

"Blindo" allows the users to link an audio file with a physical button in a **simple and intuitive way** so that all the users will find themselves comfortable with this tool.

**The blind user** could select one of the buttons and listen to the audio file linked with the specific button wearing head-phones or using an external speaker.

**The sighted user** instead could decide the suitable way of using "Blindo":
**record an audio file** using a microphone connected with the device or **upload an existing file** from USB flash drive.

The connection between the audio file and the physical button is realized using a **clean and simple graphic interface**: in this way the sighted user will be independent and able to easily change the associations or add new buttons.

The **capacitive touch screen** was indeed chosen to give a better user experience which is the focus of this project.

"Blindo" first prototype was developed using a **Raspberry Pi 3**,as a single-board computer and the software was programmed entirely in **Python3**.
