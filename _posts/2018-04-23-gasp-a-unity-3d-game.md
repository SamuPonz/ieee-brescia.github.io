## Overview
GaSP (acronym for GAme Student Project) is a project that aims to build a videogame using the Unity3D game engine. The game wants to be a 2D platformer with a minimalistic art style and with time rewind mechanics.
The player will be able to rewind and slow down time for a limited period of time, and all the gameplay challenges will be based on that. The game is being developed in C# with the help of the Unity3D interface.

### Skills
If you plan to work on this project you will most likely develop the following skills:

* Decent knowledge of the Unity3D game engine;
* Object oriented programming and C# knowledge;
* Base details of game design;
* Sprites, 2D graphics and animations;
* Sound design and implementation;
* Project management and teamwork;

Everyone is free to join and there are no special prerequisites. We're willing to provide documentation and tutorials for core concepts and to explain how game development works. The only things you'll need is the willing to learn, to work as a team and a decent C knowledge.
