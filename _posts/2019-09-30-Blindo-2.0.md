A few months have passed since the team started this beautiful experience. The members improved their skills and the project has grown bigger and bigger.

## Updates
As you can see in the image, the volume has been increased and the software has been substantially modified.

### Hardware
The new body contains all the peripheral devices: thanks to a panel made in PVC, totally transparent, all of them could be seen next to the single-board computer connected with cables.


It is also possible to turn on/off "Blindo" using a button positioned on the left side of the body.

### Software
There are a lot of updates about the software: from the change in graphics to the addition of functionalities making the device more user-friendly.

The team also added the possibility to record and listen to audio and associate physical buttons with files without using the touch screen but using the buttons on the upper surface.

This new feature will allow each user, expecially blinded kids, to use "Blindo" in a simple and intuitive way. The goal of this was and will always be **helping those in need**.

## Presentation of the prototype

All the changes made has been introduced officially to the "association for blind people" in Brescia and to the project's responsible, professor Silvano Biazzi, who is also an active member of multiple voluntary associations.

Another important guest was Pierlorenzo M. Castrovinci, member and coordinator for Lombardy region of [Informatici senza frontiere](https://www.informaticisenzafrontiere.org/), a non-profit association that undertakes to improve life conditions of people suffering because of diseases or disability using computer technologies and more.
