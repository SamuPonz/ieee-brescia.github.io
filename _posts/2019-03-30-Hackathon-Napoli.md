##	What is MetroInd4.0&IoT?
MetroInd4.0&IoT is organized with two principal aims:

* clarify the contribute of metrology that it has today for the industry 4.0 and IoT developping;
* discuss new opportunities offered by industry 4.0 and IoT to develop new equipments and measurement systems.

The ultimate aim of MetroInd4.0&IoT is to connect people who work at the developping of instrumentation and measurement systems for industry 4.0 and IoT. There exists a particular attention regarding new tecnologies for metrologically assisted production in industry 4.0 and the developping of measurement components, sensors, and conditioning systems, the latter are also intrested in calibration methods, tests and electronic measurements.
