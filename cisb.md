## What is CISB?
The “Conference of IEEE Student Branch of Brescia”, shortened to CISB, is a project conceived in October 2018 with the aim of promoting student self-organization regarding the creation of a professional-like lecture mainly about Information Engineering.
An offshoot of STB1019 project arranged the first 2018 edition.

## How to take part

The event, free of charge, is addressed to all University of Brescia pupils and externals, to whom is offered a full day of workshops and insights.
Each topic must have a single common ground with one another: Information/Knowledge.
Everything regarding Information Engineering is accepted as a potential lecture subject (e.g. from illustrating the process of videogame creation to explaining a new programming language.
Again, from the concept of artificial intelligence to one including electronic components). —> (parte inutile figa)

Rapporteurs can be both from the Student Branch or external guests.
There’s no paid retribution to those speeches.
One of the main goals of the project is finding a sponsorship in order to pay lecturers off, indeed.
Another target might be arranging a prized competition in order to reward the best subject presented during the day.
If you are interested in participating, write to the e-mail in the footer of the website for further information.

## Why we do it
Organizing such an event does not only benefit the public.
In fact, this activity brings many skills into the pockets of those who organize it. Among the advantages that we see, there are certainly:

* To get use with the organization of academic events;
* Learn to manage events involving a large number of people;
* Learn to structure posters, presentations and speeches to stimulate people to participate in the event;
* Learn to administer the authorizations and documents necessary for certain activities;
* Develop the ability to communicate with University students and involve them;
* Develop the ability to present a project or topic in public;
* Promote the STB1019 within the University;
