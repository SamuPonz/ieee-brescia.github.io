## Overview
The whole course is aimed at the consolidation of the body of knowledge acquired in class, providing a further level of challenge in the development of the same exercises.
The program is composed of many training phases, each providing the contestants with challenges in various contexts and with different objectives.

Those objectives stem from the experience of the older students (i.e. the ones who attended more courses), who are able to provide the first-year student candidates with complex sperimental problems. Thanks to the strong preparation acquired through the Basics of Programming course, the contestants can expand their knowledge about specific topics and learn to make use of the new tools provided by technological innovations.

Every contestant is bound to take part in the Arnaldo Program meetings, whose times and dates are agreed upon with everybody, in order to facilitate the participation of every candidate. The meetings are not optional, as the teaching material and the explanations are prepared through the work of the student-instructors.

The Arnaldo Program is divided in two phases, named after important cities in the life of Arnaldo da Brescia: *Paris* and *Rome*:

* *Paris*: in this phase, contestants improve their programming knowledge, developing solutions to new and uncommon problems. This phase ends with a test, whose positive result is required in order to be admitted into the next part of the program.
* *Rome*: in this phase the teaching concerns new programming tools and methodologies, used to solve a brand new set of problems. In particular, a strong focus is put on the implementation of algorithms and mathematical models.
This phase leads up to the IEEEXtreme Programming Competition: a 24 hours programming contest whose problems will challenge the contestants even more.
