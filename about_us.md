## Our Mission

**IEEE Student Branch of Brescia** is the reference for the *IEEE* (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) in Brescia.
Our **main goal** is to integrate the modus operandi of scientific research into the academic and professional career of each member, this takes place through group projects or individual research in different fields of IT.

The **Branch** offers the opportunity to *research* at the same level as IEEE members from around the world, while remaining completely immersed in the academic environment, with the support of the teaching staff and doctoral students.

The possibility to get in touch  realities other than purely scholastic allows one to have a different vision about what **developing** and **maintaining** a project mean, and also the ability to **learn** new concepts.

In addition to the *projects*, we give our members the opportunity to attend a conference, to talk about their project and the difficulties they have encountered, as well as the things they have learned; last year we have organised a conference called "**CISB**"(*Conference of IEEE Student Branch of Brescia*) on various topics including *Game Development, Kotlin, Artificial Intelligence and Virtualization*.

Within the site there are some of the *projects* we awithre developing or that we have carried out over the past years and information about our flagship program "**The Arnald Program**" and the collaborations we had since 2016.
